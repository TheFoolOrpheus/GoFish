# GoFish
A lazy implementation of GoFish in Python. Don't worry about it. For real.

I'm taking a lot of inspiration from other projects but like, don't worry about that, I got this. Will make this a real README one day, I promise.

So I decided to use the constructor as opposed to my usual not using it. And I'm also using a lot of self calls, which is also not what I usually tend to do in Python but like I said don't worry about this right now B. All in due time.
